Project Query presents a novel approach for surveying which allows one to derive discrete meaning from a pool of unparameterized responses to open ended questions. The research methodology involves recording answers to a set of questions designated for the homeless population of East Village, San Diego, California. The recordings are converted to text and saved to a google cloud database for further processing. The collected data is then used to train an NLP model, which can generate a general response for each question. This serves to summarize the overall sentiment of the population. Additionally, a clustering algorithm is employed to group similar responses and analyze the volume of each response group. This second area of focus helps to better understand the variety and urgency of each response. The study sheds light on the experiences of the homeless population and identifies meaningful patterns in their responses. Project Query endeavors to demonstrate the potential of using NLP and clustering to conduct large-scale surveys which do not compromise on human complexity and are not affected by answer-choice bias. More immediately, this research can contribute to the development of policies and interventions that address the needs of homeless individuals and communities in the San Diego area.
